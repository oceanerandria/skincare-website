                    This specific product is toward all skin types although it 
                    is mostly used by people with dry skin. I personally have a mixed
                    skin where my T-Zone is very greasy and the rest of my face is dry. 
                    This cream hydrated my skin, especially during winter. But it also
                    helped get rid of the pimples and blackheads I had on my T-Zone area.

                    This <span class="bold"> Samphire Serum </span> is based of sea-retinol, which is a type of vitamin A. Retinol 
                    cleanses your skin from any toxins. This particular product is also good for 
                    people who come in contact witht ht screen a lot since it protects the skin
                    from blue lights and screens.

                    <span class="bold"> Pure Active Gel</span> by Garnier is a great product for people who have greasy skin, especially
                    if your skin is prone to acne and blackheads. It is a gel that you can wash you face with, 
                    and will make your skin brighter and softer. When used regularly, it will make your acne 
                    get better as its main purpose is to remove blackheads.

                    I use four products. A face scrub from Nivea men to cleanse my face and to 
                    remove all toxins. Secondly, I use a foaming facial cleanser from CeraVe which 
                    cleanses and remove the sebum. I rinse off my face with water after those proudcts. 
                    Finally, I use a daily hydration lotion from Cetaphil which is to moisturize and hydrate my
                    screen. I sometimes use sunscreen lotion from Life when it is sunny outside.

                    I do not use much products when it comes to my face. The only product I 
                    use on a daily basis is the RevitaLift Night and Day cream from L'Oreal. This 
                    is to hydrate my face and also an anti-aging cream since I am in my 40s. From 
                    time to time, I use aloe vera masks or natural clay masks. We have these natural 
                    products in Madagascar so I try to make use of it.

                    I am a big fan of skincare, but I try to not overdo it. I still love 
                    keeping my skin in its natural state. Every two to three days, I use three
                    different products. I first use the samphire serum to moisturize my skin but also 
                    to protect my skin from blue lights. I continue with the Vitamin E day cream by The
                    Body Shop to hydrate my skin, especially with the cold.
